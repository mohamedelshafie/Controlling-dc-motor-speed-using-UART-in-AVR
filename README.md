# Controlling-dc-motor-speed-using-UART-in-AVR
In UART virtual terminal on Proteus, we enter for example 'A000B050C100'.
This means that motor A will rotate with 0% of his speed, motor B will rotate with 50% of his speed and motor C will rotate with 100% of his speed.
The task is made using Atmega16 and programmed using Atmel studio and was tested on Proteus 11.
